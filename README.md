# VC-Funding-Map

## Project Overview
This project was developed to get a general idea of Venture Capital funding throughout the world, to hopefully identify some key statistics or trends involving that funding. The data visualizations included in this web application showcase broad data aggregations across 3600+ cities on every continent (except Antartica) in an effort to find general funding trends. 

The data was primarily sourced from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) as a replication of [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) data from the years prior to 2015. This data was supplemented by geocoding location data using the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start). More details about the data are relayed in the following section.
